// Could also be used for other FSengine mods, but some of these may be different enough that the same patch would have strange consequences
// also, normal :HAS[@resources] filters don't seem to work here (or I don't know how to write them properly for this module). which could obviously be an issue for mass replacements,
// although this seems to work perfectly for AirplanePlus specifically, since all of its bladed engines can be presumed to run on normal jet fuel
