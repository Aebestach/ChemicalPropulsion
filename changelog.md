# 0.1.0
- Pre-release
- Add B9 tank types for new propellant combinations with mixture ratios designed to fit nicely in tanks while keeping in line with reality:
  - Bipropellants:
    - 2 Hydrazine / 3 NTO
    - 3 Kerosene / 5 LqdOxygen
    - 3 LqdHydrogen / 1 LqdOxygen
    - 7 LqdMethane / 9 LqdOxygen
    - 3 Pentaborane / 7 LqdFluorine
    - 3 LqdHydrogen / 1 LqdFluorine
  - Tripropellants:
    - 1 Kerosene / 4 LqdHydrogen / 3 LqdOxygen (equivalent to 1/3 kerolox + 2/3 hydrolox)
- Changed LiquidFuel-only fuel tanks to Kerosene.
- Changed MonoPropellant fuel tanks to Hydrazine.
- Changed engines to use new fuel types:
  - All jet LiquidFuel/IntakeAir → Kerosene/IntakeAir
  - All nuclear LiquidFuel → LqdHydrogen
  - All MonoPropellant → Hydrazine
  - All LqdHydrogen/Oxidizer → LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen
  - All LqdMethane/Oxidizer → LqdMethane/LqdOxygen
  - LiquidFuel/Oxidizer depends on the engine and mostly follows the real-life inspirations where applicable, some of which have corresponding changes to Isp for realism and balance:
