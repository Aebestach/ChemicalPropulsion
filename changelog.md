# 0.5.0
- Updated FuelMixer to 0.2.0
- Added jet engine FuelMixer integration
- Added N2F4 as an exotic advanced oxidizer in hypergolic engines
- Added part upgrades for propellant unlocks
- Added more verbose propellant descriptions
- Added patch to remove KerbalAtomics' LF mode on the LV-N "Nerv"
- Added proper support for `MultiModeEngine`s via the creation of extra `ModuleFuelMixerPropellant`s
- Added `FuelMixerPropellantCombinationConfig`s for single-propellant nuclear thermal rockets and added a switch for them to all NTRs:
  - LqdHydrogen: `ThrustMultiplier 0.3; IspMultiplier 2.4`, c.f. hydrolox `~0.765; ~1.355`
  - LqdMethane: `ThrustMultiplier 0.45; IspMultiplier 1.8`, c.f. methalox `~0.964; ~1.083`
  - LqdAmmonia: `ThrustMultiplier 0.6; IspMultiplier 1.2`, c.f. ammonilox `~0.931; ~0.978`
- Added "None" option to tank propellant switches so that bipropellant tanks can contain just the fuel or just the oxidizer. Tank mass defaults to stock dry mass if both are set to "None"
- Added LqdFluorine to aviation tanks
- Added explicit `addedVolume` and `addedMass` parameters to all `ModuleFuelMixerPropellant`s
- Improved generation of `ModuleB9PartSwitch` propellant switches, so they should be more reliable
- Changed fuel mixtures available on liquid fuel engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP—Hydrazine
  - Keroxide: Kerosene / HTP
  - Hypergolic: Hydrazine—Pentaborane / NTO-N2F4
  - Ammonilox: LqdAmmonia / LqdOxygen-LqdFluorine (currently unassigned, but can be used in NTRs with an oxidizer-augmented mode)
  - Kerolox: Kerosene / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed two engines from kerolox to hypergolic type, since there were not many hypergolic engines assigned after the introduction of keroxide:
  - LV-TX87 "Bobcat" (Making History), since it's based on the LR-87 which was used with hypergolic propellants for most of its history
  - RE-L20 "Labrador" (Labradoodle), since it kind of looks like an RD-170 and same as above
- Assigned keroxide type to basic stock and Restock+ liquid fuel engines:
  - LV-1R "Spider"
  - 24-77 "Twitch"
  - Mk-55 "Thud"
  - LV-1 "Ant"
  - 48-7S "Spark"
  - LV-T30 "Reliant"
  - LV-T45 "Swivel"
  - LV-303 "Pug"
  - LV-T15 "Valiant"
- Assigned hydrogen type to engines which are already defined with LqdHydrogen as sole propellant
- Buffed exotic propellant isp multipliers:
  - Pentaborane: 1.14 → 1.55
  - LqdFluorine: 1.12 → 1.2
- Minor adjustment to jet engine propellant ratios to maintain exactly the same IntakeAir and mass flow rates as stock
- Minor changes to part titles and VABOrganizer category titles
- Removed LqdAmmonia as a hypergolic fuel option
- Removed bipropellant `FuelMixerPropellantCombinationConfig`s since they are made redundant by rebalanced `FuelMixerPropellantConfig`s
# 0.4.1
- Changed multimode engines to use FuelMixer, though currently without any propellant switcher (though FuelMixer can support this).
- Added support for stock multimode engines
- Added support for Near Future Aeronautics multimode engines
- Added support for Kerbal Atomics multimode engines
- Added support for WildBlueIndustries Mk-33
- Added `hydrogenJet` engine type
- Fixed tanks with built-in engines using a different propellant, e.g. bipropellant tanks with solid fuel separators
- Fixed FuelMixer default propellant assignment for monopropellant engines and multi-type engines, e.g. bipropellant RCS (kerolox, methalox and hydrolox)
- Fixed B9PartSwitch togglable integrated tanks on engines, which should now apply their volume to FuelMixer
# 0.4.0
- Renamed from "Immersive Chemical Propulsion" to "Chemical Propulsion"
- Rewrote a good chunk of the patches using new FuelMixer plugin (0.1.0) to handle monopropellant and bipropellant fuel tanks, engines and RCS
- Changed fuel mixtures available on bipropellant engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP—Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: LqdAmmonia—Hydrazine—Pentaborane / NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene / HTP—LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed fuel cells to only use LqdHydrogen+LqdOxygen and ISRU to only deal with LqdHydrogen, LqdOxygen, LqdMethane and HTP in order to balance the more effective propellants by the lack of ISRU, and in preparation for Chemical Conversion which will handle all of this more comprehensively
- Various tidying of code and small fixes
# 0.3.0
- Introduced HTP as a basic monopropellant and Kerosene/HTP as a basic hypergolic bipropellant
- Added switches to engines, tanks, RCS for a pair of "basic" and "advanced" (higher Isp, more expensive) propellants for the five liquid engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP — Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: Kerosene/HTP — Hydrazine/NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene/LqdOxygen — Pentaborane/LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane/LqdOxygen — Diborane/LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen — LqdHydrogen/LqdFluorine
- Removed Hydrazine and NTO recipes from ISRU in favour of a consistency (only basic propellants allowed)
- Changed everything to use Immersive Chemical Core 0.3.0 common resource colours
- Added common propellant ratios used throughout all patches
- Restored original stats for the LV-T30 "Reliant" and the LV-T45 "Swivel", since the lower-Isp constraint on low tech engines is now handled by the use of Kerosene/HTP (note that no tech restrictions actually exist yet)
- Balanced Restock+'s Pug against other hypergolic engines:
  - LV-303 'Pug' Liquid Fuel Engine [250-330 → 220-310s]
- Fixed stats of Near Future Launch Vehicles's Rutherford analogues to reflect their real performance and balanced them with the other kerolox engines:
  - KS-1E 'Goldfish' Liquid Fuel Engine [270-280s → 270-310s]
  - KR-1E-V 'Angora' Liquid Fuel Engine [250-320 → 220-340s]
# 0.2.0
- Added generic targeting of integrated fuel tanks on boosters using the engine propellant type
- Added native fuel tank switch for more control. Replaces existing switches, so removes the dependency on CryoTanks
- Added native RCS bipropellant switch for more control. Replaces existing switches, e.g. the one provided by Near Future Launch Vehicles
- Added support for Near Future Aeronautics aviation fuel tanks
- Added support for VABOrganizer, with new categories for different types of engine and RCS. This adds subcategorisation to many parts which didn't already have any, including tanks
- Added flags for Immersive Chemical Core 0.2.0 CryoTanks boiloff system, which should ensure all cryogenic fuels are given boiloff configs no matter where the are stored
- Fixed tank type patch ordering
- Fixed Pentaborane/LqdFluorine B9 tank type mass and cost (exotics coming soon)
# 0.1.3
- Improved propellant type assignment targeting, should fix some odd cases where copies of parts inherit the wrong propellant type
- Changed engine name replacement to use terms which characterise the propellant combination: "Kerolox", "Methalox" and "Hydrolox"
- Moved hydrolox options behind methalox in tanks and other places, so that they're broadly ordered by specific impulse (Hypergolic < Kerolox < Methalox < Hydrolox)
- Add descriptions to propellant combinations, only used in RCS switches at the moment
- Added MissingHistory support:
  - LV-303 "Pug": Hypergolic, stats unchanged
  - LV-T15 "Valiant": Hypergolic, stats unchanged
  - Other engines handled automatically
- Added Labradoodle support:
  - RE-L20 "Labrador": Kerolox, stats unchanged

# 0.1.2
- Fixed catch-all engine type patch which converts all not-directly-supported engines into Hydrazine/NTO
- Added simple regex which replaces "Liquid Fuel" in engine titles with "Hypergolic", "Kerosene", "Liquid Hydrogen", "Liquid Methane" or "Kero-Hydro-Lox" (ideally this would hook into localisation, but only supports English for now)
- Replaced MonoPropellant with Hydrazine in tanks contained in B9 part switches, e.g. the integrated tanks on the orbital maneuvering engines from Near Future Spacecraft

# 0.1.1
- Fixed patches targeting presence of MakingHistory with ModuleManager NEEDS
- Changed Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" to use LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen since it makes a good Aerojet M-1 analogue, which is seemingly how Restock treats it, with performance balanced accordingly:
  - 1750kN, 310-430s
- Balanced hydrolox engines:
  - Making History RE-I2 "Skiff" / Restock+ RE-I2 'Caravel': 300/510kN → 31kN, 1.6/2t → 1.4t (30% thrust scaled J-2 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25 "Vector": 1000kN → 675kN, 4t → 3t (30% thrust scaled RS-25 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth": 4000kN → 2700kN, 15t → 12t (4x S3 KS-25 "Vector")
  - CryoEngines CE-60 'Tharsis': 360kN → 320kN, 3t → 2.4t (2x CE-60 'Pavonis')
  - Restock+ KR-10A 'Corgi': 750kN → 220kN, 5.25t → 2.2t (4x CryoEngines CE-10 'Hecate')
- Balanced hypergolic engines:
  - LV-T30 "Reliant": Vacuum 310s → 300s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - LV-T45 "Swivel": Vacuum 320s → 310s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - RE-J10 "Wolfhound": 375kN → 110kN, 3.3t → 0.8t (Restock+ RE-137 'Schnauzer' stats, which are much more sensible)

# 0.1.0
