# 0.1.1
- Fixed patches targeting presence of MakingHistory with ModuleManager NEEDS
- Changed Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" to use LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen since it makes a good Aerojet M-1 analogue, which is seemingly how Restock treats it, with performance balanced accordingly:
  - 1750kN, 310-430s
- Balanced hydrolox engines:
  - Making History RE-I2 "Skiff" / Restock+ RE-I2 'Caravel': 300/510kN → 31kN, 1.6/2t → 1.4t (30% thrust scaled J-2 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25 "Vector": 1000kN → 675kN, 4t → 3t (30% thrust scaled RS-25 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth": 4000kN → 2700kN, 15t → 12t (4x S3 KS-25 "Vector")
  - CryoEngines CE-60 'Tharsis': 360kN → 320kN, 3t → 2.4t (2x CE-60 'Pavonis')
  - Restock+ KR-10A 'Corgi': 750kN → 220kN, 5.25t → 2.2t (4x CryoEngines CE-10 'Hecate')
- Balanced hypergolic engines:
  - LV-T30 "Reliant": Vacuum 310s → 300s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - LV-T45 "Swivel": Vacuum 320s → 310s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - RE-J10 "Wolfhound": 375kN → 110kN, 3.3t → 0.8t (Restock+ RE-137 'Schnauzer' stats, which are much more sensible)

# 0.1.0
- Pre-release
- Add B9 tank types for new propellant combinations with mixture ratios designed to fit nicely in tanks while keeping in line with reality:
  - Bipropellants:
    - 2 Hydrazine / 3 NTO
    - 3 Kerosene / 5 LqdOxygen
    - 3 LqdHydrogen / 1 LqdOxygen
    - 7 LqdMethane / 9 LqdOxygen
    - 3 Pentaborane / 7 LqdFluorine
    - 3 LqdHydrogen / 1 LqdFluorine
  - Tripropellants:
    - 1 Kerosene / 4 LqdHydrogen / 3 LqdOxygen (equivalent to 1/3 kerolox + 2/3 hydrolox)
- Changed LiquidFuel-only fuel tanks to Kerosene.
- Changed MonoPropellant fuel tanks to Hydrazine.
- Changed engines to use new fuel types:
  - All jet LiquidFuel/IntakeAir → Kerosene/IntakeAir
  - All nuclear LiquidFuel → LqdHydrogen
  - All MonoPropellant → Hydrazine
  - All LqdHydrogen/Oxidizer → LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen
  - All LqdMethane/Oxidizer → LqdMethane/LqdOxygen
  - LiquidFuel/Oxidizer depends on the engine and mostly follows the real-life inspirations where applicable, some of which have corresponding changes to Isp for realism and balance:
